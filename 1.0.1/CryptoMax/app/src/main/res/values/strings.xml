    <string name="private_key_agreement_header_1">1. What\'s a private key?</string>
    <string name="private_key_agreement_body_1">
        The wallet that you are about to create has what\'s called a private key. This private key is a long string of characters, and is required to make
        transactions with the wallet. The wallet also has what\'s called an address. This address is what others use to send funds to you.
    </string>
    <string name="private_key_agreement_header_2">2. Private key safety</string>
    <string name="private_key_agreement_body_2">
        There are two very important things that you must do with your private key in order to keep your funds safe. The first is that you should never give, or
        show anyone your private key. If somebody gets a hold of your private key, they will have complete control over your wallet and will be able steal all of your
        funds. The second thing that you must do is keep a paper copy of your private key somewhere safe. The reason for this is because the address for the wallet is
        derived from the private key. This means that if you lose your address, it\'s possible to recover it using your private key. However, the opposite is not true.
        That is, if you lose your private key it cannot be recovered, and your funds will be gone forever. For that reason, it\'s extremely important that you keep a paper
        copy of your private key in a separate place that\'s not on this device. The CryptoMax app does save a version of this private key on the device, but this version is
        encrypted with the password that you set in the previous steps. This means if the data on the device gets lost, or you forget your password, you will never be able to
        access your funds.

    <string name="private_key_agreement_body_3">
        By clicking \"I understand\", you are accepting responsibility for the safety of your private key and are waiving any right to hold CryptoMax accountable for lost funds.
        Upon clicking \"I understand\", CryptoMax will display your private key as a QR code, as well as give you the option to copy the text version to your clipboard. This will
        be your only chance to back it up. After that, you will not be able to see your private key again.
